                    <P>
                        Photography is a process that helps in defining the procedure to create stationary or moving pictures using photographic lens in a camera. It works by recording rays on a sensitive medium that can be an electronic sensor, or a photographic film. Photographs are developed using the “negatives” film. Light patterns get produced or reproduced by objects .
